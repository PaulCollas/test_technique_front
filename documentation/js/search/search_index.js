régions via API\nSélection dynamique des départements\nAffichage des communes dans un composant tableau personnalisé\nIntégration de composants Angular + PrimeNG\nMise en place d’un design conforme au prototype (typographies, mises en page, vidéo de fond…)\n\nLe but est de démontrer :\n✔️ la maîtrise d’Angular\n\n✔️ l’intégration et personnalisation UI / UX\n\n✔️ l’architecture standalone et signals\n\n✔️ l’usage cohérent de composants réutilisables\n(Retour)\n\n\n\nPrérequis\n\nNode.js (version recommandée : LTS)  👉 https://nodejs.org/\n\nNPM (installé automatiquement avec Node)\n\nAngular CLI (version 20)\n\nnpm install -g @angular/cli\n\n\n\nAPI\n\nRécupérer le nom des régions pour l’autocomplétion:\n\n\nhttps://geo.api.gouv.fr/regions?nom=nomDeLaRegion\n\n\nRécupérer la liste des départements d’une région :\n\n\nhttps://geo.api.gouv.fr/regions/{code région}/departements\n\n\nRécupérer la liste des communes d’un départements :\n\n\nhttps://geo.api.gouv.fr/departements/{code departement}/communes\n\n(Retour)\n\n\n\n\n🎯 Démarrer le projet\nPour lancer le projet :\nInstallation\n\nCloner le repositoryExample :git clone https://github.com/PaulCollas/test_technique_front.git\nInstaller les NPM packagesExample :npm install\n\nLancer l'application\n\nLancer l'application Angular :\nExample :ng serve\nLancer la documentation : \nExample :ng serve\n\n(Retour)\n\n\n📚 Documentation\nPour ce projet, j'ai rédigé et utilisé la documentation de la manière suivante : \n\nFigma (version recommandée : LTS)\n\n\nLien d'accès au Figma : \n\nLien du fichier Figma avec les maquettes, composants, assets etc\n\n\nPrototype : \n\nLien du prototype\n\n\n\n\nStoryBook (version recommandée : LTS)\n\n\nLancer le storybook : \nnpm run storybook\n\n\nAccès au storybook : \nhttp://localhost:6006/\n\n\n\n\n🚀 Utilisation\nUne fois lancé, le projet permet :\n\nde rechercher une région via autocomplétion\nd’afficher les départements associés\nd’accéder à la liste de leurs communes\nd’utiliser un tableau custom PrimeNG enrichi\nde naviguer entre les pages grâce au routing Angular\n\n(Retour)\n\n\n\n\n🗺️ Futures évolutions\n\n[] Ajouter Changelog\n[] Finaliser l'intégration StoryBooks\n[] Ajouter le Multi-language\n\n(Retour)\n\n\n\n\n🤝 Contribuer\nLes contributions sont les bienvenues !\n\nForker le
